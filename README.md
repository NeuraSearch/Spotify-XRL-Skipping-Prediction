# Spotify-XRL-Skipping-Prediction

An investigation on the utility of users’ historical data for the task of sequentially predicting users’ music skipping behaviour using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The analysis is performed on the [Spotify’s Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (MSSD)](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge).

This repository will soon be updated to contain the source code for the approach outlined in the Full Paper **Why People Skip Music? On Predicting Music Skips using Deep Reinforcement Learning**, accepted and to be published in the proceedings of the _2023 ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval_ ([CHIIR2023](https://sigir.org/chiir2023)).

A YouTube presentation on the submitted version of the paper will also be soon made available.
